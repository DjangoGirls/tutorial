# জ্যাঙ্গো এডমিন ( Django admin) 

আমরা জ্যাঙ্গো এডমিন ব্যবহার করে মডেলকৃত পোষ্ট যোগ , সংযুক্ত বা সম্পাদন এবং ডিলিট করতে পারবো।

Let's open the `blog/admin.py` file in the code editor and replace its contents with this:

{% filename %}blog/admin.py{% endfilename %}

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

As you can see, we import (include) the Post model defined in the previous chapter. To make our model visible on the admin page, we need to register the model with `admin.site.register(Post)`.

OK, time to look at our Post model. Remember to run `python manage.py runserver` in the console to run the web server. Go to your browser and type the address http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. You will see a login page like this:

![Login page](images/login_page2.png)

To log in, you need to create a *superuser* - a user account that has control over everything on the site. Go back to the command line, type `python manage.py createsuperuser`, and press enter.

> Remember, to write new commands while the web server is running, open a new terminal window and activate your virtualenv. We reviewed how to write new commands in the **Your first Django project!** chapter, in the **Starting the web server** section.

{% filename %}Mac OS X or Linux:{% endfilename %}

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py createsuperuser
    

{% filename %}Windows:{% endfilename %}

    (myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> python manage.py createsuperuser
    

When prompted, type your username (lowercase, no spaces), email address, and password. **Don't worry that you can't see the password you're typing in – that's how it's supposed to be.** Type it in and press `enter` to continue. The output should look like this (where the username and email should be your own ones):

    Username: ola
    Email address: ola@example.com
    Password:
    Password (again):
    Superuser created successfully.
    

Return to your browser. Log in with the superuser's credentials you chose; you should see the Django admin dashboard.

Go to Posts and experiment a little bit with it. Add five or six blog posts. Don't worry about the content –- it's only visible to you on your local computer -- you can copy-paste some text from this tutorial to save time. :)

Make sure that at least two or three posts (but not all) have the publish date set. It will be helpful later.

If you want to know more about Django admin, you should check Django's documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/

This is probably a good moment to grab a coffee (or tea) or something to eat to re-energize yourself. You created your first Django model – you deserve a little break!
