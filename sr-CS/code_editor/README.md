# Editor koda

> For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the [Installing Python & Code Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTaqzKZCdA&t=4m43s) video.

Uskoro ćete napisati svoju prvu liniju koda, tako da je vreme da skinete editor koda!

> **Note** If you're using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the [Chromebook Setup](../chromebook_setup/README.md) instructions. The cloud IDE you chose (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE or AWS Cloud9) includes a code editor, and when you open a file in your IDE from the File menu, you will automatically be using the editor.
> 
> **Note** You might have done this earlier in the Installation chapter – if so, you can skip right ahead to the next chapter!
