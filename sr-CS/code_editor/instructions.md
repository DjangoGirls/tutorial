Postoji puno različitih editora i izbor se uglavnom svodi na lične preference. Većina Python programera koriste veoma kompleksne IDE (Integrated Development Environments), poput PyCharm-a. Početniku su, međutim, manje podesni. Naše preporuke su jednako moćne, ali znatno jednostavnije.

Our suggestions are below, but feel free to ask your coach what their preferences are – it'll be easier to get help from them.

## Zašto instaliramo editor koda?

Možda se pitate zašto instaliramo poseban editor koda umesto da koristimo nešto poput Word-a ili Notepad-a.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :)
