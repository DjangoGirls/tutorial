## Virtual environment

Before we install Django, we'll get you to install an extremely useful tool that will help keep your coding environment tidy on your computer. It's possible to skip this step, but it's highly recommended not to - starting with the best possible setup will save you a lot of trouble in the future!

So, let's create a **virtual environment** (also called a *virtualenv*). It will isolate your Python/Django setup on a per-project basis, meaning that any changes you make to one website won't affect any others you're also developing. Neat, right?

All you need to do is find a directory in which you want to create the `virtualenv`; your home directory, for example. On Windows it might look like `C:\Users\Name\` (where `Name` is the name of your login).

For this tutorial we will be using a new directory `djangogirls` from your home directory:

    mkdir djangogirls
    cd djangogirls

We will make a virtualenv called `myvenv`. The general command will be in the format:

    python -m venv myvenv

### Windows

To create a new `virtualenv`, you need to open the console (we told you about that a few chapters ago - remember?) and run `C:\Python\python -m venv venv`. It will look like this:

    C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> C:\Python34\python -m venv myvenv

where `C:\Python34\python` is the directory in which you previously installed Python and `myvenv` is the name of your `virtualenv`. You can use any other name, but stick to lowercase and use no spaces. It is also good idea to keep the name short - you'll be referencing it a lot!

### Linux and OS X

Creating a `virtualenv` on both Linux and OS X is as simple as running `python3 -m venv myvenv`.
It will look like this:

    ~/djangogirls$ python3 -m venv myvenv

`myvenv` is the name of your `virtualenv`. You can use any other name, but stick to lowercase and use no spaces. It is also good idea to keep the name short - you'll be referencing it a lot!

> __NOTE:__ Initiating the virtual environment on Ubuntu 14.04 like this currently gives the following error:

>     Error: Command '['/home/eddie/Slask/tmp/venv/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1

> To get around this, use the `virtualenv` command instead.

>     ~/djangogirls$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
>     ~/djangogirls$ virtualenv myvenv


## Working with virtualenv

The command above will create a directory called `myvenv` (or whichever name you chose) that contains our virtual environment (basically bunch of directory and files). All we want to do now is starting it by running:

    C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> myvenv\Scripts\activate

on Windows, or:

    ~/djangogirls$ source myvenv/bin/activate

on OS X and Linux.

Remember to replace `myvenv` with your chosen `virtualenv` name!

> __NOTE:__ sometimes `source` might not be available. In those cases try doing this instead:

>     ~/djangogirls$ . myvenv/bin/activate



You will know that you have `virtualenv` started when you see that the prompt in your console looks like:

    (myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls>

or:

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$

Notice the prefix `(myvenv)` appears!

When working within a virtual environment, `python` will automatically refer to the correct version so you can use `python` instead of `python3`.

OK, we have all important dependencies in place. We can finally install Django!

## Installing Django

Now that you have your `virtualenv` started, you can install Django using `pip`. In the console, run `pip install django==1.6.6` (note that we use a double equal sign: `==`).

    (myvenv) ~$ pip install django==1.6.6
    Downloading/unpacking django==1.6.6
    Installing collected packages: django
    Successfully installed django
    Cleaning up...

> If you get an error when calling pip on Ubuntu 12.04 please run `python -m pip install -U --force-reinstall pip` to fix the pip installation in the virtualenv.

That's it! You're now (finally) ready to create a Django application! But to do that, you need a nice program to write your code in...
