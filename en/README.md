## Welcome
Welcome to the Django Girls Tutorial! We are happy to see you here. :) In this tutorial, we will take you on a journey under the hood of web technologies, offering you a glimpse of all the bits and pieces that need to come together to make the web work as we know it.

As with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine. :)

## Introduction

Have you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology to which you cannot (yet) relate? Have you ever wondered how to create a website but have never had enough motivation to start? Have you ever thought that the software world is too complicated for you to even try doing something on your own?

Well, we have good news for you! Programming is not as hard as it seems and we want to show you how fun it can be.

This tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer. If you want to be good at it, you need months or even years of learning and practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating websites is not as complicated as it seems. We will try to explain different bits and pieces as well as we can, so you will not feel intimidated by technology.

We hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we do!

## What will you learn during the tutorial?

Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a small working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!

It will (more or less) look like this:

> If you work with the tutorial on your own and don't have a coach who will help you in case of any problem, we have a chat system for you: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial.svg)](https://gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial). We asked our coaches and previous attendees to be there from time to time and help others with the tutorial! Don't be afraid to ask your question there!

OK, [let's start at the beginningâ€¦](./how_the_internet_works/README.md)

## Following the tutorial at home

It is amazing to take part in a Django Girls workshop, but we are aware that it is not always possible to attend one. This is why we encourage you to try following this tutorial at home. For readers at home, we are currently preparing videos that will make it easier to follow the tutorial on your own. It is still a work in progress, but more and more things will be covered soon at the [Coding is for girls](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hNd2uW8jTR5K3KBzRuG2A/feed) YouTube channel.

In every chapter already covered, there is a link that points to the correct video.
