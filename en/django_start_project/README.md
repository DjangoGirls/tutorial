We're going to create a simple blog!

The first step is to start a new Django project. Basically, this means that we'll run some scripts provided by Django that will create the skeleton of a Django project for us. This is just a bunch of directories and files that we will use later.

The names of some files and directories are very important for Django. You should not rename the files that we are about to create. Moving them to a different place is also not a good idea. Django needs to maintain a certain structure to be able to find important things.

> Remember to run everything in the virtualenv. If you don't see a prefix `(myvenv)` in your console you need to activate your virtualenv. We explained how to do that in the __Django installation__ chapter in the __Working with virtualenv__ part. Typing `myvenv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or
`source myvenv/bin/activate` on Mac OS / Linux will do this for you.

In your MacOS or Linux console you should run the following command; **don't forget to add the period (or dot) `.` at the end**:

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ django-admin startproject mysite .

On Windows; **don't forget to add the period (or dot) `.` at the end**:

    (myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> django-admin startproject mysite .

> The period `.` is crucial because it tells the script to install Django in your current directory (for which the period `.` is a short-hand reference)

> **Note** When typing the commands above, remember that you only type the part which starts `django-admin` or `django-admin.py`.
The`(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$` and `(myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls>` parts shown here are just examples
of the prompt that will be inviting your input on your command line.

`django-admin.py` is a script that will create the directories and files for you. You should now have a directory structure which looks like this:

    djangogirls
    ├───manage.py
    └───mysite
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
            __init__.py


`manage.py` is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else, amongst other things.

The `settings.py` file contains the configuration of your website.

Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? `urls.py` file contains a list of patterns used by `urlresolver`.

Let's ignore the other files for now as we won't change them. The only thing to remember is not to delete them by accident!


## Changing settings

Let's make some changes in `mysite/settings.py`. Open the file using the code editor you installed earlier.

It would be nice to have the correct time on our website. Go to the [wikipedia timezones list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and copy your relevant time zone (TZ). (eg. `Europe/Berlin` )

In settings.py, find the line that contains `TIME_ZONE` and modify it to choose your own timezone:

```python
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'
```

Modifying "Europe/Berlin" as appropriate


We'll also need to add a path for static files (we'll find out all about static files and CSS later in the tutorial). Go down to  the *end* of the file, and just underneath  the `STATIC_URL` entry, add a new one called `STATIC_ROOT`:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
```


## Setup a database

There's a lot of different database software that can store data for your site. We'll use the default one, `sqlite3`.

This is already set up in this part of your `mysite/settings.py` file:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```

To create a database for our blog, let's run the following in the console: `python manage.py migrate` (we need to be in the `djangogirls` directory that contains the `manage.py` file). If that goes well, you should see something like this:

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py migrate
    Operations to perform:
      Synchronize unmigrated apps: messages, staticfiles
      Apply all migrations: contenttypes, sessions, admin, auth
    Synchronizing apps without migrations:
       Creating tables...
          Running deferred SQL...
       Installing custom SQL...
    Running migrations:
      Rendering model states... DONE
      Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
      Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
      Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
      Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
      Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
      Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
      Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
      Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
      Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK

And we're done! Time to start the web server and see if our website is working!

You need to be in the directory that contains the `manage.py` file (the `djangogirls` directory). In the console, we can start the web server by running `python manage.py runserver`:

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver

If you are on Windows and this fails with `UnicodeDecodeError`, use this command instead:

    (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver 0:8000


Now all you need to do is check that your website is running. Open your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer or whatever you use) and enter the address:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The web server will take over your command prompt until you stop it. To type more commands whilst it is running open a new terminal window and activate your virtualenv. To stop the web server, switch back to the window in which it's running and pressing CTRL+C - Control and C buttons together (on Windows, you might have to press Ctrl+Break).

Congratulations! You've just created your first website and run it using a web server! Isn't that awesome?
