We're going to create a simple blog!

The first step towards creating it is to start a new Django project. Basically, this means that we'll run some scripts provided by Django that will create the skeleton of a Django project for us: a bunch of directories and files that we will later use.

The names of some files and directories are very important for Django. You should not rename the files that we are about to create. Moving them to a different place is also not a good idea. Django needs to maintain a certain structure in order to be able to find important things.

> Remember to run everything in the virtualenv. If you don't see a prefix `(myvenv)` in your console you need to activate your virtualenv. We explained how to do that in the __Django installation__ chapter in the __Working with virtualenv__ part. You can do that by typing the following command: `myvenv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or
`myvenv/bin/activate` on Mac OS / Linux.

In your MacOS or Linux console you should run the following command; **don't forget to add the period (or dot) `.` at the end**:

```:command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ django-admin startproject mysite .
```

On Windows; **don't forget to add the period (or dot) `.` at the end**:

```:command-line
(myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> django-admin.py startproject mysite .
```

> The period `.` is crucial because it tells the script to install Django in your current directory (for which the period `.` is a short-hand reference)

> **Note** When typing the commands above, remember that you only type the part which starts `django-admin` or `django-admin.py`. 
The`(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$` and `(myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls>` parts shown here are just examples
of the prompt that will be inviting your input on your command line.

`django-admin.py` is a script that will create the directories and files for you. You should now have a directory structure which looks like this:

```:command-line
djangogirls
├───manage.py
└───mysite
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        __init__.py
```


`manage.py` is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else, amongst other things.

The `settings.py` file contains the configuration of your website.

Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? `urls.py` file contains a list of patterns used by `urlresolver`.

Let's ignore the other files for now - we won't change them. The only thing to remember is not to delete them by accident!


## Changing settings

Let's make some changes in `mysite/settings.py`. Open the file using the code editor you installed earlier.

It would be nice to have the correct time on our website. Go to the [wikipedia timezones list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and copy your relevant time zone (TZ). (eg. `Europe/Berlin` )

In settings.py, find the line that contains `TIME_ZONE` and modify it to choose your own timezone:

```python:mysite/settings.py
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'
```

Modifying "Europe/Berlin" as appropriate


We'll also need to add a path for static files (we'll find out all about static files and CSS later in the tutorial). Go down to  the *end* of the file, and just underneath  the `STATIC_URL` entry, add a new one called `STATIC_ROOT`:

```python:mysite/settings.py
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
```


## Setup a database

There's a lot of different database software that can store data for your site. We'll use the default one, `sqlite3`.

This is already set up in this part of your `mysite/settings.py` file:

```python:mysite/settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```

To create a database for our blog, let's run the following in the console: `python manage.py migrate` (we need to be in the `djangogirls` directory that contains the `manage.py` file). If that goes well, you should see something like this:

```:command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

And we're done! Time to start the web server and see if our website is working!

You need to be in the directory that contains the `manage.py` file (the `djangogirls` directory). In the console, we can start the web server by running `python manage.py runserver`:

```:command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver
```

If you are on Windows and this fails with `UnicodeDecodeError`, use this command instead:

```:command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver 0:8000
```


Now all you need to do is check that your website is running - open your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer or whatever you use) and enter the address:

```:browser
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

The web server will take over your command prompt until you stop it: to type more commands either open a new terminal window (and don't forget to activate your virtualenv in it too), or stop the web server by switching back to the window in which it's running and pressing CTRL+C - Control and C buttons together (on Windows, you might have to press Ctrl+Break).

Congratulations! You've just created your first website and run it using a web server! Isn't that awesome?
