### Windows

You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). You can hit "next" on all steps except for one; in the fifth step entitled "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (the bottom option). Other than that, the defaults are fine. Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings is good.

### MacOS

Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and just follow the instructions.

### Linux

If it isn't installed already, git should be available via your package manager, so try:


#### Debian or Ubuntu

    $ sudo apt-get install git


#### Fedora (up to 21)

    $ sudo yum install git


#### Fedora (22+)

    $ sudo dnf install git


#### openSUSE

    $ sudo zypper install git
