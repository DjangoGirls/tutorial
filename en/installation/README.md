# If you're doing the tutorial at home

If you're doing the tutorial at home, not at one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/), you can completely skip this chapter now and go straight to the [How the Internet works?](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter.

This is because we cover these things in the whole tutorial anyway, and this is just an additional page that gathers all of the installation instructions in one place. The Django Girls event includes one "Installation evening" where we install everything so we don't need to bother with it during the workshop, so this is useful for us.

If you find it useful, you can follow through this chapter too. But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on your computer, skip this chapter and we will explain the installation part to you later on.

Good luck!

# Installation
In the workshop you will be building a blog, and there are a few setup tasks in the tutorial which would be good to work through beforehand so that you are ready to start coding on the day.

# Chromebook setup (if you're using one)
{% include "/chromebook_setup/instructions.md" %}

# Install Python
{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Set up virtualenv and install Django
{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install a code editor
{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# Install Git
{% include "/deploy/install_git.md" %}

# Create a GitHub account
Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account.

# Create a PythonAnywhere account
{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}


# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../python_introduction/README.md)

* [What is Django?](../django/README.md)


# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Django project!](../django_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
