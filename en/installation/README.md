# If you're doing the tutorial at home

If you're doing the tutorial at home, not at one of the 
[Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/), you can completely 
skip this chapter now and go straight to the 
[How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter.

This is because we cover installing things as they are needed in the tutorial
-- this is just an additional page that gathers all of the installation 
instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats). 
You can choose to install everything that is on this page right now if you wish. 
But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on 
your computer, skip this chapter and we will explain the installation parts to 
you later on, as they are needed.

Good luck!

# If you're attending a workshop

If you are attending one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/):
- Your workshop may have an "installation party" before the main workshop. 
  If you are at an installation party, this page is for you! 
  Follow the instructions here to get everything you need for the workshop 
  installed, with the help of the coaches if needed. 
  Then at the main workshop, you'll be able to skip installation instructions 
  you'll encounter in the main tutorial when you get to them.
- The organizers of your workshop may have asked you to try at home to install 
  everything on your computer before the workshop starts. If you have been asked 
  to do that, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here, as best you can. 
  Then at the main workshop, when you get to an installation step in the main 
  tutorial, if you were not able to get that piece installed you can get help 
  from your coach.
- If your workshop does not have an installation party (or you couldn't attend), 
  and if the organizers didn't ask you to try to install everything before you 
  arrived, skip this page and go straight to the 
  [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter. 
  You'll be installing everything you need as you work through the tutorial.

# Installation
In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go 
through the tutorial you'll be instructed on how to install various software 
on your computer and set up some online accounts as needed (if you are using 
local desktop environment) or instructed on how to create online accounts only 
(if you are using cloud development). 
This page presents you with available choices of development environments and 
let's you choose which operating system/platform you would like to use.

# Cloud Development
In this tutorial, the cloud development platform we will be using will be 
[RunCode](https://runcode.io/). RunCode is a cloud development environment 
which people can use without the need to install Python, Django and Visual 
Studio Code editor locally on their machines. This cloud environment enables 
anyone to work from any device that has an internet connection, including 
cellphones, tablets, laptop or desktop.

This removes the need for you to install packages on a borrowed laptop or 
the need for you to own a laptop to attend the workshop or follow this tutorial 
from home as you only need to set up three online accounts. 
This will also save you time required for setting up your development 
environment. 
You can always do the local installation later own on your computer using the 
guide for your operating system as a follow-up after finishing the tutorial. 
However, loading the development enviroment requires good and fast internet 
for this solution to work for you.

> **Note** There are sections of this tutorial which depend on the platform 
you are working on. If you follow the local installation steps for Windows, 
Linux, OS X or Chromebook, you will need to follow instructions for your 
operating system. 
If you follow RunCode Cloud Environment setup instructions, then you will 
need to follow instructions for RunCode development environment. 
For this reason, the tutorial has been divided into sections based on these 
platforms. 
Feel free to explore instructions for other platforms if you hve time.

# Pick your operating system/platform
To install software or setup your development environment and follow the 
tutorial, please pick your operating system or platform which you will be 
following the tutorial on.

* [ChromeBook](../chromebook/README.md)
* [Linux](../linux/README.md)
* [Mac OSX](../macosx/README.md)
* [RunCode Cloud](../runcode/README.md)
* [Windows](../windows/README.md)

Enjoy the workshop!
