## Python prompt

> For readers at home: this part is covered in the 
[Python Basics: Integers, Strings, Lists, Variables and Errors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO63L4s-20U) video.

To start playing with Python, we need to open up a *command line* on your computer. 
You should already know how to do that – you learned it in the 
[Intro to Command Line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md) chapter.

Once you're ready, follow the instructions below.

We want to open up a Python console, so type in `python3` on Mac OSX and hit `enter`.

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
$ python3
Python {{ book.py_release }} (...)
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
