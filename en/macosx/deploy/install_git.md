Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This software 
can track changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 
A bit like the "track changes" feature in word processor programs 
(e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer), but much more powerful.

## Installing Git

Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.

During installation, if you are presented with the option of "Adjusting the name 
of the initial branch in new repositories", please choose to "Override the default" 
and use "main". 
This will align your installation of Git with the broad direction of the global 
developer community, and the "main" branch will be used through the remainder of 
this tutorial. 
Please see https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/ and 
https://github.com/github/renaming for further discussion of this subject. 

> **Note** If you are running OS X 10.6, 10.7, or 10.8, you will need to install 
the version of git from here:
