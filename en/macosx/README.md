# OS X Installation

> **Note** If you already worked through the installation steps, no need to do this again â€“ you can skip straight ahead to 
[How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md).

# Installation
In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll be instructed on how 
to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as needed. This page gathers all of the installation 
and sign-up instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).

To install software on your machine, follow the instructions below:

## Brief intro to the command line {#intro-command-line}
Many of the steps below reference the "console", "terminal", "command window", or "command line" -- these all mean the same thing: 
a window on your computer where you can enter commands. When you get to the main tutorial, you'll learn more about the command line. 
For now, the main thing you need to know is how to open a command window and what it looks like:

{% include "intro_to_command_line/open_instructions.md" %}

## Install Python {#python}
{% include "python_installation/instructions.md" %}

## Install a code editor {#code-editor}
{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

## Set up virtualenv and install Django {#virtualenv}
{% include "django_installation/instructions.md" %}

## Install Git {#git}
{% include "deploy/install_git.md" %}

## Create a GitHub account {#github-account}
Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to remember your password (add it 
to your password manager, if you use one).

## Create a PythonAnywhere account {#pythonanywhere}
{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}

# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start 
reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../macosx/intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../macosx/python_introduction/README.md)

* [What is Django?](../django/README.md)


# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to[Your first Django project!](../macosx/django_start_project/README.md) 
because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
