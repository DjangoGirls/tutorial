Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. 
This software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall 
specific versions later. 
A bit like the "track changes" feature in word processor programs 
(e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer), but much more powerful.

## Installing Git

You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). 
You can hit "next" on all steps except for two: in the step where it asks to 
choose your editor, you should pick Nano, and in the step entitled 
"Adjusting your PATH environment", choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from 
the Windows Command Prompt" (the bottom option). 
Other than that, the defaults are fine. 
Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings is good.

During installation, if you are presented with the option of 
"Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories", 
please choose to "Override the default" and use "main". 
This will align your installation of Git with the broad direction of the global 
developer community, and the "main" branch will be used through the remainder 
of this tutorial. 
Please see https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/ and 
https://github.com/github/renaming for further discussion of this subject. 

Do not forget to restart the command prompt or PowerShell after the installation 
finished successfully.
