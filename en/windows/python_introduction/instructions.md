On Windows Command Prompt, it will be like this:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
> cd %HomePath%\Desktop
```

And on Windows Powershell, it will be like this:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
> cd $Home\Desktop
```

If you get stuck, ask for help. That's exactly what the coaches are here for!

Now use Python to execute the code in the file like this:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```python
> python python_intro.py
```

Note: on Windows 'python3' is not recognized as a command. Instead, use 'python' to execute the file.
