# Code editor

> For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the [Installing Python & Code Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTaqzKZCdA&t=4m43s) video.

You're about to write your first line of code, so it's time to download a code editor!

> **Note** If you're using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the [Chromebook Setup](../chromebook_setup/README.md) instructions.

> **Note** You might have done this earlier in the Installation chapter â€“ if so, you can skip right ahead to the next chapter!
