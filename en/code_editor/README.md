# Code editor

You're about to write your first line of code, so it's time to download a code editor!

There are a lot of different editors and it largely boils down to personal preference. Most Python programmers use complex but extremely powerful IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), such as PyCharm. As a beginner, however, that's probably less suitable; our recommendations are equally powerful, but a lot simpler.

Our suggestions are below, but feel free to ask your coach what their preferences are - it'll be easier to get help from them.

## Gedit

Gedit is an open-source, free editor, available for all operating systems.

## Sublime Text 2

Sublime Text is a very popular editor with a free evaluation period. It's easy to install and use, and it's available for all operating systems.

## Atom

# Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like rtf.

The second reason is that code editors are specialised in editing code, so they can provide helpful features, like highlighting code with colour according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favourite tools :)
