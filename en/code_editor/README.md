# Code editor

> For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the [Installing Python & Code Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTaqzKZCdA&t=4m43s) video.

You're about to write your first line of code, so it's time to download a code editor!

> **Note** You might have done this earlier in the  [Installation chapter](../installation/README.md) – if so, you can skip right ahead to the next chapter!
> 
> **Note** If you are coding on RunCode, this step is not necessary as Visual Studio Code is pre-installed on RunCode - if so you can skip right ahead to the next chapter!
