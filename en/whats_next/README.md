# What's next?

Congratulate yourself! __You're totally awesome__. We're proud! <3

### What to do now?

Take a break and relax! You have just done something really huge.

After that, make sure to follow Django Girls on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/djangogirls) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djangogirls) to stay up to date.

### Can you recommend any further resources?

Yes! There are a _lot_ of resources online for learning all kinds of programming skills – it can be pretty daunting to work out where to go next, but we've got you covered. Whatever your interests were before you came to Django Girls, and whatever interests you've developed throughout the tutorial, here are some free resources (or resources with large free components) you can use to get to where you want to be.
