If you're on Mac or Linux, you probably see a `$`, like this:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
$
```
<!--endsec-->

<!--sec data-title="Prompt: Windows" data-id="windows_prompt2" data-collapse=true ces-->


On Windows, you probably see a `>`, like this:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
>
```

Take a look at the Linux section just above now -- you'll see something more like that when you get to PythonAnywhere later in the tutorial.

Each command will be prepended by a `$` or `>` and one space, but you should not type it. Your computer will do it for you. :)

> Just a small note: in your case there may be something like `C:\Users\ola>` or `Olas-MacBook-Air:~ ola$` before the prompt sign, and this is 100% OK.

The part up to and including the `$` or the `>` is called the *command line prompt*, or *prompt* for short. It prompts you to input something there.

In the tutorial, when we want you to type in a command, we will include the `$` or `>`, and occasionally more to the left. Ignore the left part and only type in the command, which starts after the prompt.
