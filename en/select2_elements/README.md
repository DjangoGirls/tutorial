# Select2 elements

Forms with just text are fine, and our model only contains CharField fields.
In general, model classes will be linked with each other, and some fields
will be a link to objects from a different class.

Let's start small, let's just add a field to our blog post, that indicates
the category of the post.  Think of "history", or "nature", "family", or
"science".  not all your thoughts fall in the same category!

We're going to alter the model, ask Django to create a migration on the
model, store it in the repository â€” necessary for the deployment, run it.
We'll do some minimal further adjustment, and appreciate the power and
flexibility of what we did in the previous Forms step.  Then we'll explore
the ``select2`` external module.

This is the change to the ``models.py`` file:

{% filename %}blog/models.py{% endfilename %}

     created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
     published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
```

And let's make sure our PostForm class informs its base class of the new field:

Shall we make this new field also visible in the post list?  Again, the
addition in ``diff`` format.

```diff

   <p>{{ post.text|linebreaksbr }}</p>
 </div>
 {% endfor %}
```

With this code in place, the blog site will not work any more: it will
complain about the still not existing 'category' field.  After all, we just
added to the model, and what does the database know of what we write in our
Python code?  Nothing as of now, and everything, as soon as we ask Django to
come in rescue, with its 'migrations'.

Run the following two commands from the {% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}
```
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py makemigrations blog
Migrations for 'blog':
  blog/migrations/0002_post_category.py
    - Add field category to post
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py migrate blog
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, blog, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying blog.0002_post_category... OK
```

And again run the server.

Navigate to your localhost, and take notice of what we changed.  In the
list, you see a four-chars text, in front of each post title.  This is the
code of the category.  In the post_edit form, you will see a new ``select``
element.  Experiment with changing a few, and see what happens in the
``post_list``.  Do notice how the ``post_list`` shows the internal code,
while the ``select`` element offers the human readable equivalent.

Now let's make it prettier, let's show an image instead of the category
code.  That's easy, simply put some pictures in the new
``blog/static/images/`` directory, one per category, then edit the list view:

```diff
modified   blog/templates/blog/post_list.html
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 {% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

   <p>{{ post.text|linebreaksbr }}</p>
 </div>
 {% endfor %}
```

The ``{% static 'images/' %}`` tag translates to the base location for our
pictures.  Following immediately, without spaces, we have the file name,
from the category.  Notice that ``post.category`` was the four-letter code,
stored in the database.  When you create a FOO ``CharField`` indicating a
choices list, Django defines a corresponding ``get_FOO_display`` method for
your field.  In Python, you would invoke the method to get the associated
value, in Django template language this is not the case, and the method is
implicitly evaluated.

## select2

Does the select element look ugly to you?  It does to me.  And that was the
whole idea behind adding this page to the tutorial: making sure we get a
pretty site, and to do so by using select2.

According to their documentation, we have **very** little to do, in order to
get it working, that is a bit of an optimistic statement, so let's have a
look.

This is indeed very little code, but a lot is going on here, and we're not
even ready yet.

We added jQuery to our network imports, we mention ``django_select2`` both
in the requirements file and in the INSTALLED_APPS, we added the url
patterns from ``django_select2``, and finally, the possibly most relevant
change, we attach some extra information to our ``category`` field in the
PostForm, instructing the ``forms.ModelForm`` base class to use the
``django_select2.Select2Widget`` widget class instead of its default widget.

And that was it basically.  The rest is handled by the frameworks we are
using.
