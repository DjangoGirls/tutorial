You're about to write your first line of code, so it's time to download a code editor!

> **Note** If you're using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the [Chromebook Setup](../chromebook_setup/README.md) instructions. The cloud IDE you chose (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE or AWS Cloud9) includes a code editor, and when you open a file in your IDE from the File menu, you will automatically be using the editor.
> 
> **Note** You might have done this earlier in the Installation chapter – if so, you can skip right ahead to the next chapter!
