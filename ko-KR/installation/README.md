# 집에서 이 튜토리얼을 보는 분들에게

[Django 걸스 이벤트](https://djangogirls.org/events/)가 아닌 집에서 튜토리얼을 따라하시는 분들은 이 챕터를 넘기고 [인터넷은 어떻게 작동할까요?](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) 로 바로 넘어가세요.

이 챕터는 (워크샵에 사용하기 유용하도록) 튜토리얼에서 필요한 모든 프로그램의 설치 안내를 한곳에 모은 추가적인 페이지입니다. 만일 원하신다면 이 페이지에 있는 모든 것을 인스톨 하실수도 있고, 컴퓨터에 이것저것 설치하기 전에, 먼저 학습을 시작하고 싶다면 이번 장을 건너뛰셔도 됩니다. 뒷 부분에서도 설치에 대한 내용을 다루게 될 거에요.

모두 행운을 빌어요!

# 만일 워크샵에 참석하신 분이라면

If you are attending one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/):

* Your workshop may have an "installation party" before the main workshop. If you are at an installation party, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here to get everything you need for the workshop installed, with the help of the coaches if needed. Then at the main workshop, you'll be able to skip installation instructions you'll encounter in the main tutorial when you get to them.
* The organizers of your workshop may have asked you to try at home to install everything on your computer before the workshop starts. If you have been asked to do that, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here, as best you can. Then at the main workshop, when you get to an installation step in the main tutorial, if you were not able to get that piece installed you can get help from your coach.
* If your workshop does not have an installation party (or you couldn't attend), and if the organizers didn't ask you to try to install everything before you arrived, skip this page and go straight to the [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter. You'll be installing everything you need as you work through the tutorial.

# Installation

In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll be instructed on how to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as they are needed. This page gathers all of the installation and sign-up instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).

# Brief intro to the command line {#command-line}

Many of the steps below reference the "console", "terminal", "command window", or "command line" -- these all mean the same thing: a window on your computer where you can enter commands. When you get to the main tutorial, you'll learn more about the command line. For now, the main thing you need to know is how to open a command window and what it looks like: {% include "/intro_to_command_line/open_instructions.md" %}

# Python 설치하기 {#python}

{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Code Editor 설치하기 {#code-editor}

{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# virtualenv 설정 & Django 설치하기 {#virtualenv}

{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Git 설치하기 {#git}

{% include "/deploy/install_git.md" %}

# GitHub 계정 만들기 {#github}

Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).

# PythonAnywhere 계정 만들기 {#pythonanywhere}

{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}

# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../python_introduction/README.md)

* [What is Django?](../django/README.md)

# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Django project!](../django_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
