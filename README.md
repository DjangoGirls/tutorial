This command line tool use `make` to create development environment. It is optional to use this tool. While building the document, it builds the document for every language. The build process can be limited to any one language using this tool and reduce build time considerbly. Afterwards, the translation to other languages are done from crowdin localization process.

Usage instructions are available though `make help` command.

## New content and complex changes

For adding new chapters, writing longer snippets of text or adding images, you need to get a copy of the tutorial to your local computer.

Either use the GitHub app for your operating system (mentioned above) or `git` command line to get the repository locally. You get the repository address from the front page of your own GitHub repository fork:

    git clone git@github.com:yourgithubusername/tutorial.git

Move to the folder containing the project, to run the following commands.

    cd tutorial

Then, create a branch for your new changes to sit in. It helps to call the branch something related to the changes you are going to make.

    git checkout -b contributing

Install the project's requirements using [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install).

    npm install

To preview and serve local files, with auto-reload capabilities, run HonKit using:

    npx honkit serve

The local server will be available at http://localhost:4000.
If auto-reload is slow, you can temporarily remove unwanted languages from `LANGS.md`, to speed up the process.

Then commit the changes using `git` and push the changes to your remote GitHub repository.

Example:

    $ git status
    On branch contributing
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        contributing_and_editing_this_book/images/gitbook.png

    $ git add contributing_and_editing_this_book/images/gitbook.png

    $ git commit -m "Added gitbook editor screenshot"
