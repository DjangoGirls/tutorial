# Getting started and prerequisites

For contributing to the tutorial the following is needed to get started:

* a [Github account](https://github.com)
* in the case of complex edits familiarity with [Git command line basics](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) or familiarity with an app ([Windows](https://windows.github.com/), [Mac](https://mac.github.com/)) to push your edits made on your computer to Github.

# Editing chapter content

## Simple changes

For simple changes like typo corrections you can use the Github online editor:

* Open your local fork page on Github,
* go to *README.md* file in any chapter,
* press the *Edit* icon (pen)

and you can edit the chapter directly on github.com.

Save your changes and create a pull request as explained below.

## New content and complex changes

For adding new chapters, writing longer snippets of text or adding images, you need to get a copy of the tutorial to your local computer.

Either use the Github app for your operating system (mentioned above) or `git` command line to get the repository locally. You get the repository address from the front page of your own Github repository fork:

    git clone git@github.com:yourgithubusername/tutorial.git

Then, create a branch for your new changes to sit in. It helps to call the branch something related to the changes you are going to make.

    git checkout -b contributing

Download the [Gitbook Editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor) app to your computer.

Then you can open the tutorial in Gitbook Editor (*File* > *Open book*).

Make any changes in the tutorial using Gitbook and then save changes (*Book* > *Save all*).

Then commit the changes using `git` and push the changes to your remote Github repository.

Example:

    $ git status
    On branch contributing
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        contributing_and_editing_this_book/images/gitbook.png

    $ git add contributing_and_editing_this_book/images/gitbook.png

    $ git commit -m "Added gitbook editor screenshot"

# Making a pull request

After you have finished your changes you need to create [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)  on Github. DjangoGirls will get notified about the pull request, review your changes, suggest any corrections if needed and then *pull* your changes to the master version.

In your own repository on Github press do *Compare & pull request*

![Gitbook](contributing/images/pull_request.png)

Fill in the information *why* this change is being made. The reviewer can see the details of the actual change, so you don't need repeat the content of the change.

Then press *Create pull request*.

Github emails will notify you for the follow up process.
