PythonAnywhere is a service for running Python code on servers "in the cloud". We'll use it for hosting our site, live and on the Internet.

We will be hosting the blog we're building on PythonAnywhere. Sign up for a "Beginner" account on PythonAnywhere (the free tier is fine, you don't need a credit card).

> **Note** When choosing your username here, bear in mind that your blog's URL will take the form `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`, so choose either your own nickname or a name for what your blog is all about. Also, be sure to remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).

## Creating a PythonAnywhere API token

This is something you only need to do once. When you've signed up for PythonAnywhere, you'll be taken to your dashboard. Find the link near the top right to your "Account" page:

![Account link on the top right on the page](../deploy/images/pythonanywhere_account.png)

then select the tab named "API token", and hit the button that says "Create new API token".
