# 假如你是在家裡使用這份教材

If you're doing the tutorial at home, not at one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/), you can completely skip this chapter now and go straight to the [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter.

因為這章節的內容含概在整份教材中，本章節是附加頁面，它將所有安莊指令集中在一個地方。 The Django Girls event includes one "Installation evening" where we install everything so we don't need to bother with it during the workshop, so this is useful for us.

If you find it useful, you can follow this chapter too. But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on your computer, skip this chapter and we will explain the installation part to you later on.

祝你好運！

# 安裝

在這個研討會中，你將建立一個部落格；教材中有一些前置設定作業最好先完成，這樣這天你就可以開始寫程式了。

<!--sec data-title="Chromebook setup (if you're using one)"
data-id="chromebook_setup" data-collapse=true ces--> {% include "/chromebook_setup/instructions.md" %} 

<!--endsec-->

# 安裝 Python

{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install a code editor

{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# Set up virtualenv and install Django

{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# 安裝 Git

{% include "/deploy/install_git.md" %}

# 建立 GitHub 帳號

到 [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) 註冊一個新的、免費的帳戶。

# 建立 PythonAnywhere 帳戶

{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}

# 開始閱讀

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [網際網路是如何運作](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [命令行簡介](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Python 簡介](../python_introduction/README.md)

* [Django 是什麼?](../django/README.md)

# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Django project!](../django_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
