Možeš [odmah preskočiti ovaj dio](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#install-python) ako ne koristiš Chromebook. Ako ipak koristiš, tvoje će iskustvo instalacije biti malo drugačije. Možeš ignorirati ostatak uputa za instalaciju.

### Cloud IDE

Cloud 9 je alat koji ti daje uređivač koda i pristup računalu pokrenutom na Internetu gdje možeš instalirati, pisati i pokretati programsku potporu (eng. software). Za vrijeme tutorijala, Cloud 9 služit će kao tvoj *lokalni stroj*. I dalje ćeš pokretati naredbe u terminalu kao i tvoji kolege iz razreda na OS X, Ubuntu ili Windowsima, ali tvoj će terminal biti povezan na računalo pokrenuto negdje drugdje gdje ga Cloud 9 postavi za tebe. Ovde su instrukcij za Cloud IDEs You can choose one of the cloud IDEs, and follow the instruction of the cloud IDE.

#### PaizaCloud Cloud IDE

1. Go to [PaizaCloud Cloud IDE](https://paiza.cloud/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Click *New Server* and choose the Django app
4. Click Terminal button(on the left side of the window)

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, buttons at the left. Click "Terminal" button to open terminal window with prompt like this:

{% filename %}Terminal{% endfilename %}

    $
    

The terminal on the PaizaCloud Cloud IDE is prepared for your instructions. You can resize or maximize that window to make it a bit bigger.

#### AWS Cloud9

Currently Cloud 9 requires you to sign up with AWS and enter credit card information.

1. Install Cloud 9 from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud9/nbdmccoknlfggadpfkmcpnamfnbkmkcp)
2. Go to [c9.io](https://c9.io) and click *Get started with AWS Cloud9*
3. Sign up for an AWS account (requires credit card information, but you can use it for free)
4. In the AWS Dashboard, enter *Cloud9* in the search bar and click it
5. In the Cloud 9 dashboard, click *Create environment*
6. Name it *django-girls*
7. While configuring settings, select *Create a new instance for environment (EC2)* for "Environment Type" and the *t2.micro* "Instance type" (it should say "Free-tier eligible."). The default cost-saving setting is fine and you can keep the other defaults.
8. Click *Next step*
9. Click *Create environment*

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, a big main window with some text, and a small window at the bottom that looks something like this:

{% filename %}bash{% endfilename %}

    yourusername:~/workspace $
    

This bottom area is your terminal. You can use the terminal to send instructions to the remote Cloud 9 computer. You can resize that window to make it a bit bigger.

### Virutalno okruženje

A virtual environment (also called a virtualenv) is like a private box we can stuff useful computer code into for a project we're working on. We use them to keep the various bits of code we want for our various projects separate so things don't get mixed up between projects.

Run:

{% filename %}Cloud 9{% endfilename %}

    mkdir djangogirls
    cd djangogirls
    python3.6 -mvenv myvenv
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    pip install django~={{ book.django_version }}
    

(note that on the last line we use a tilde followed by an equal sign: `~=`).

### GitHub

Make a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

### Python Anywhere

The Django Girls tutorial includes a section on what is called Deployment, which is the process of taking the code that powers your new web application and moving it to a publicly accessible computer (called a server) so other people can see your work.

This part is a little odd when doing the tutorial on a Chromebook since we're already using a computer that is on the Internet (as opposed to, say, a laptop). However, it's still useful, as we can think of our Cloud 9 workspace as a place for our "in progress" work and Python Anywhere as a place to show off our stuff as it becomes more complete.
