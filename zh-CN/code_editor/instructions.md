有很多不同的编辑器，通常根据个人偏好选择。 大部分 Python程序员使用像 PyCharm这样复杂但是功能强大的IDE (集成开发环境)。 然而，这可能不太适合初学者。我们建议使用同样强大但是更为简单的编辑器。

Our suggestions are below, but feel free to ask your coach what their preferences are – it'll be easier to get help from them.

## 我们为什么要安装代码编辑器？

你可能会疑惑为什么我们要安装代码编辑器软件，而不是使用如 Word 或记事本这样的软件。

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your favorite tools. :)
