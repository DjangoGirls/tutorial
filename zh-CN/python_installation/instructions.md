Django由Python编写。 我们需要Python来完成Django中的一切。 让我们从安装开始 ！ 我们希望您能安装最新版本的 Python 3，所以如果您有任何旧版本，请将其更新。 如果您拥有版本3.4或更高版本，也是也没有问题的。

即使您已经在计算机上安装过Anaconda，也请安装以下的普通Python。

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: Windows" data-id="python_windows" data-collapse=true ces-->

首先，请在系统信息页的”系统类型“中检查您的计算机拥有的是32位系统还是64位系统的Windows。您可以使用以下任意一种方式来进入这个页面：

* 同时按Windows键和暂停/关闭键
* 从Windows菜单打开您的控制面板，进入”系统&安全“，再进入”系统“。
* 按下Windows按钮，然后寻找设置 > 系统 > 关于
* 在Windows开始菜单搜索”系统信息“。 完成这点，需要按启动按钮或Windows键，然后输入`系统信息`。 It will start making suggestions as soon as you type. You can select the entry once it shows up.

You can download Python for Windows from the website https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. Click on the "Latest Python 3 Release - Python x.x.x" link. If your computer is running a **64-bit** version of Windows, download the **Windows x86-64 executable installer**. Otherwise, download the **Windows x86 executable installer**. After downloading the installer, you should run it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there.

One thing to watch out for: During the installation, you will notice a window marked "Setup". Make sure you tick the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" or 'Add Python to your environment variables" checkbox and click on "Install Now", as shown here (it may look a bit different if you are installing a different version):

When the installation completes, you may see a dialog box with a link you can follow to learn more about Python or about the version you installed. Close or cancel that dialog -- you'll be learning more in this tutorial!

Note: if you are using an older version of Windows (7, Vista, or any older version) and the Python 3.6.x installer fails with an error, you can try either:

1. install all Windows Updates and try to install Python again; or
2. install an [older version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), e.g., [3.4.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-346/).

If you install an older version of Python, the installation screen may look a bit different than shown above. Make sure you scroll down to see "Add python.exe to Path", then click the button on the left and pick "Will be installed on local hard drive":

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: OS X" data-id="python_OSX"
data-collapse=true ces-->

> **Note** Before you install Python on OS X, you should ensure your Mac settings allow installing packages that aren't from the App Store. Go to System Preferences (it's in the Applications folder), click "Security & Privacy," and then the "General" tab. If your "Allow apps downloaded from:" is set to "Mac App Store," change it to "Mac App Store and identified developers."

You need to go to the website https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/ and download the Python installer:

* Download the *Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer* file,
* Double click *python-3.6.1-macosx10.6.pkg* to run the installer.

<!--endsec-->

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: Linux" data-id="python_linux"

It is very likely that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed (and which version it is), open a console and type the following command:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.6.1
    

If you have a different version of Python installed, at least 3.4.0 (e.g. 3.6.0), then you don't have to upgrade. If you don't have Python installed, or if you want a different version, first check what Linux distribution you are using with the following command:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ grep '^NAME=' /etc/os-release
    

Afterwards, depending on the result, follow one of the following installation guides below this section.

<!--endsec-->

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: Debian or Ubuntu" data-id="python_debian" data-collapse=true ces-->

Type this command into your console:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ sudo apt install python3
    

<!--endsec-->

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: Fedora" data-id="python_fedora"
data-collapse=true ces-->

Use this command in your console:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ sudo dnf install python3
    

If you're on older Fedora versions you might get an error that the command `dnf` is not found. In that case, you need to use `yum` instead.

<!--endsec-->

<!--sec data-title="Install Python: openSUSE" data-id="python_openSUSE"
data-collapse=true ces-->

Use this command in your console:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ sudo zypper install python3
    

<!--endsec-->

Verify the installation was successful by opening a command prompt and running the `python3` command:

{% filename %}command-line{% endfilename %}

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.6.1
    

The version shown may be different from 3.6.1 -- it should match the version you installed.

**NOTE:** If you're on Windows and you get an error message that `python3` wasn't found, try using `python` (without the `3`) and check if it still might be a version of Python that is 3.4.0 or higher. If that doesn't work either, you may open a new command prompt and try again; this happens if you use a command prompt left open from before the Python installation.

If you have any doubts, or if something went wrong and you have no idea what to do next, please ask your coach! Sometimes things don't go smoothly and it's better to ask for help from someone with more experience.
