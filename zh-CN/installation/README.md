# 如果你在家做这个练习

If you're doing the tutorial at home, not at one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/), you can completely skip this chapter now and go straight to the [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter.

这是因为下面的这些步骤包含在整个教程当中，这只是一个额外的页面，把所有的安装说明收集在了一起。 The Django Girls event includes one "Installation evening" where we install everything so we don't need to bother with it during the workshop, so this is useful for us.

If you find it useful, you can follow this chapter too. But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on your computer, skip this chapter and we will explain the installation part to you later on.

祝你好运！

# 安装

在线下教程中，你会建立一个博客，有一些配置任务最好能够在之前完成，那样你就可以在那一天直接开始编程。

<!--sec data-title="Chromebook setup (if you're using one)"
data-id="chromebook_setup" data-collapse=true ces--> {% include "/chromebook_setup/instructions.md" %} 

<!--endsec-->

# 安装Python

{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install a code editor

{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# Set up virtualenv and install Django

{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# 安装 Git

{% include "/deploy/install_git.md" %}

# 创建一个 Github 账户

前往 [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) 并注册一个新的账号。

# 创建一个 PythonAnywhere 帐户

{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}

# 开始阅读

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [互联网是如何工作的？](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [命令行介绍](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Python 简介](../python_introduction/README.md)

* [Django 是什么？](../django/README.md)

# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Django project!](../django_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
