# Ако правите ръководството у дома

Ако правите урока у дома, а не на някое от събитията на [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/events/), можете напълно да пропуснете тази глава сега и да отидете направо към главата [Как работи Интернет](../how_the_internet_works/README.md).

Това е така, защото покриваме инсталирането на неща, каквито са необходими в урока - това е само допълнителна страница, която събира всички инструкции за инсталиране на едно място (което е полезно за някои формати на работилницата). Можете да изберете да инсталирате всичко, което е на тази страница в момента, ако желаете. Но ако искате да започнете да научавате неща, преди да инсталирате куп неща на вашия компютър, пропуснете тази глава и ние ще ви обясним по-късно инсталационните части, тъй като те са необходими.

Късмет!

# Ако посещавате уъркшоп

Ако присъствате на някое от събитията на [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/events/):

* Your workshop may have an "installation party" before the main workshop. If you are at an installation party, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here to get everything you need for the workshop installed, with the help of the coaches if needed. Then at the main workshop, you'll be able to skip installation instructions you'll encounter in the main tutorial when you get to them.
* The organizers of your workshop may have asked you to try at home to install everything on your computer before the workshop starts. If you have been asked to do that, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here, as best you can. Then at the main workshop, when you get to an installation step in the main tutorial, if you were not able to get that piece installed you can get help from your coach.
* If your workshop does not have an installation party (or you couldn't attend), and if the organizers didn't ask you to try to install everything before you arrived, skip this page and go straight to the [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter. You'll be installing everything you need as you work through the tutorial.

# Installation

In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll be instructed on how to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as they are needed. This page gathers all of the installation and sign-up instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).

# Brief intro to the command line {#command-line}

Many of the steps below reference the "console", "terminal", "command window", or "command line" -- these all mean the same thing: a window on your computer where you can enter commands. When you get to the main tutorial, you'll learn more about the command line. For now, the main thing you need to know is how to open a command window and what it looks like: {% include "/intro_to_command_line/open_instructions.md" %}

# Install Python {#python}

{% include "/python_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install a code editor {#code-editor}

{% include "/code_editor/instructions.md" %}

# Set up virtualenv and install Django {#virtualenv}

{% include "/django_installation/instructions.md" %}

# Install Git {#git}

{% include "/deploy/install_git.md" %}

# Create a GitHub account {#github}

Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).

# Create a PythonAnywhere account {#pythonanywhere}

{% include "/deploy/signup_pythonanywhere.md" %}

# Start reading

Congratulations, you are all set up and ready to go! If you still have some time before the workshop, it would be useful to start reading a few of the beginning chapters:

* [How the internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md)

* [Introduction to the command line](../intro_to_command_line/README.md)

* [Introduction to Python](../python_introduction/README.md)

* [What is Django?](../django/README.md)

# Enjoy the workshop!

When you begin the workshop, you'll be able to go straight to [Your first Django project!](../django_start_project/README.md) because you already covered the material in the earlier chapters.
